# Software Requirements Document (SRD)

## Project Title: Instant and Collaborative File Sharing Web Application

### Prepared by: Nikita Darmora


---

## 1. Introduction

In the digital era, efficient and secure file sharing is vital for productivity and collaboration. This web-based application is designed to offer both **anonymous instant file sharing** and **authenticated collaborative file management**, catering to individual users and professional teams alike. It focuses on eliminating friction in quick file transfers and providing a structured platform for team-based collaboration. The platform allows users to share files like digital "toffees"‚Äîquickly, easily, and accessibly.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Current solutions often lack the flexibility to support both **quick anonymous sharing** and **secure collaborative workspaces**. Users are frequently required to sign up even for one-time transfers, while collaboration platforms fail to offer streamlined file sharing without login. This creates a need for a unified platform that supports both modes effectively.

---

## 3. Objectives

* Enable file sharing **without login** for quick and anonymous use.
* Support **secure user authentication** using JWT and password hashing.
* Allow users to **create and join workspaces** with access via username and password.
* Provide functionality to **add, edit, and delete** files inside a workspace.
* Implement **role-based permissions** (viewer, editor, owner).
* Offer secure **edit/delete controls** and **access codes** for private folders.
* Provide a clean, **responsive user interface** accessible from any device.

---

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 Anonymous Sharing

* Drag-and-drop interface for instant upload.
* Generate temporary shareable links.
* Auto-expiry of shared files after 24 hours.

### 4.2 Registered Users & Workspaces

* JWT-based login system with hashed password storage.
* Users can:

  * Register/login with secure credentials.
  * Create new workspaces or join existing ones using an invite or access code.
  * Add, edit, or delete files within a workspace.
  * Set folder as public, private, or code-accessible.

### 4.3 Collaboration Workspace

* Shared workspaces visible only to joined users.
* Workspace-level permissions (viewer/editor/owner).
* Co-editing of documents and in-app commenting/chat.
* Recycle bin for deleted items and version control for updated files.

### 4.4 Folder & File Access Control

* Invite-based or code-based access for restricted folders.
* Unauthorized access is denied at folder level.
* Role-specific actions allowed based on permission.
