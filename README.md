# FileToffee - Secure File Sharing Platform ðŸš€
  This project aims to build a secure and user-friendly web-based file sharing platform - FileToffee -enabling both anonymous quick file sharing and authenticated collaborative workspace management. The system allows users to upload, share, and manage files through intuitive features and role-based permissions. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it leverages modern technologies like JWT authentication, bcrypt encryption, and RESTful APIs to ensure security and performance. 

OBJECTIVE: 
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a full-stack file sharing application that: 
  ï‚· Enables anonymous instant file uploads with shareable links. 
  ï‚· Supports secure user registration and login using JWT and hashed passwords. 
  ï‚· Provides workspace management for collaboration and file versioning. 
  ï‚· Allows role-based access control for operations like upload, delete, and rename. 
  ï‚· Ensures real-time responsiveness across devices. 

SCOPE:  
The project offers a dual-mode experience: 
  ï‚· Quick Share: Upload files anonymously without account creation. Generates temporary links with 24-hour expiry. 
  ï‚· Collaborative Workspaces: Registered users can create/join shared workspaces, organize files, and collaborate via comments and file versioning. 

Use Cases: 
  ï‚· Team collaboration 
  ï‚· Personal file management 
  ï‚· One-time file transfers 
  ï‚· Secure document sharing within organizations  
 
METHODOLOGY: 
1. User Registration & Authentication 
   ï‚· JWT-based user registration and login. 
  ï‚· Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt. 
  ï‚· Tokens manage session state securely. 
2. Anonymous File Sharing 
  ï‚· Users drag and drop files onto the UI. 
  ï‚· Files are uploaded and assigned unique shareId links. 
  ï‚· Links are valid for 24 hours with auto-expiry implemented. 
3. Workspace Creation & Collaboration 
  ï‚· Users can create and manage workspaces. 
  ï‚· Files can be added to specific folders. 
  ï‚· Access can be given through invitation codes or links. 
  ï‚· Members are assigned roles (Viewer, Editor, Owner). 
4. File Operations 
  ï‚· Upload, rename, move, delete, and restore files. 
  ï‚· Deleted files move to a recycle bin with restore options. 
  ï‚· Version control maintains history of edits or uploads. 
5. Real-Time UI 
  ï‚· Responsive frontend developed in React.js. 
  ï‚· Role-based dashboards and file visibility. 
  ï‚· User feedback via status toasts, modals, and theme switching. 
 
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
  Project Name: Instant and Collaborative File Sharing Web Application 
  Language Used: JavaScript (Node.js for backend, React.js for frontend) 
  Type: Full-Stack File Management and Sharing Platform 

TECHNOLOGIES USED: 
â€¢ Frontend: 
  o React.js â€“ A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces with component-based architecture. 
  o React Router â€“ Manages navigation and routing between application views. 
  o Axios â€“ Handles HTTP requests between the client and backend API. 
  o CSS â€“ Ensures responsive and user-friendly visual design across devices. 
  
â€¢ Backend: 
  o Node.js â€“ A JavaScript runtime environment used to build fast and scalable server-side applications. 
  o Express.js â€“ A minimalist web framework for creating robust APIs and handling middleware. 
  
â€¢ Database: 
  o MongoDB â€“ A flexible NoSQL database used for storing user, file, and workspace data in JSON-like format. 
  o Authentication & Security: 
  o JWT (JSON Web Token) â€“ Provides stateless authentication through token-based login sessions. 
  o bcrypt â€“ Encrypts user passwords before storing them securely in the database. 
  
â€¢ File Storage: 
  o Local File System â€“ Files are stored locally on the server during development. 
  o AWS S3 / Firebase (Optional) â€“ Can be integrated for scalable cloud based file storage in production. 
  
â€¢ Utilities & Supporting Libraries: 
  o Multer â€“ Middleware for handling multipart/form-data used in file uploads. 
  o UUID â€“ Generates unique IDs for each uploaded or shared file. 
  o dotenv â€“ Loads environment variables from .env file into process.env. 
  o express-validator â€“ Adds input validation and sanitization to backend routes. 
  o concurrently â€“ Allows simultaneous running of backend and frontend during development. 
  o nodemon â€“ Automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected. 
  
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS: 
  ï‚· Backend APIs: Built with Express and structured into RESTful endpoints (/api/users, /api/files, /api/workspaces). 
  ï‚· Frontend React App: Modular components for login, dashboard, quick share, workspace, and theme control. 
  ï‚· File Management: multer handles file upload. Metadata stored in MongoDB. 
  ï‚· Error Handling: Robust backend responses, validation via express validator. 
  ï‚· Security: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (cors) and secure headers used.
  
EXPECTED OUTCOME: 
â€¢ A fully functional file sharing web application that supports: 
â€¢ Quick, anonymous file upload 
â€¢ Secure user authentication 
â€¢ Collaborative workspace management 
â€¢ File access control and versioning 
â€¢ A clean, intuitive user interface that adapts to all devices. 
â€¢ Deployment-ready codebase for production environments (Render/Vercel).
